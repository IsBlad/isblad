Hi 👋, I’m Isabelle, an aspiring front-end web developer who enjoys creating intuitive and  
aesthetically pleasing web experiences. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS,  
Photoshop, Illustrator, and Git, I bring a blend of technical skills and creativity to   
every project.

One of my proudest achievements is collaborating on LanguaMate AI, an AI-driven web app for  
language learners that automatically generates vocabulary lists and classroom activities   
using generative AI. As part of my final project at General Assembly, I handled the   
front-end development while my partner managed the back-end. We were thrilled to earn top   
marks for our work..🌟

I’m driven by the goal of becoming a great front-end developer and designer, constantly   
improving my craft and exploring new technologies.

When I’m not coding, you can find me indulging in baking 🍰, arts and crafts 🎨, or enjoying the    
beauty of nature 🌿.
